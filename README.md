## Rcode:

### Main.R â€“ creates all plots displayed in the MS, script accessess several other R scripts

### 00_NBE_MergeRawData: merges raw data, i.e. count data for each sampling with biovolume measurements

### 01_NBE_temperature_planktotrons.R: creates temperature curves for each treatment

### 02_NBE_BiomassFigure_supplement.R: Total and species-specific biomass for mono- and multi-species cultures

### 03_NBES_calculation.R: Analysis of net biodiversity effect on stability (NBES) using the Overall Ecological Vulnerability metric (OEV, Urrutia-Cordero et al. 2021), resistance and temporal stability, measured as Coefficient of Variation (CV)

### 04_NBE_HectorLoreau_NetBiodivEffect.R: calculation of the net biodiversity effect on ecosystem functioning after Loreau and Hector (2001). 

### 03_NBE_Statistics_Contrasts.R: Statistics introduced to analyse the influence of temperature and species composition on the NBES as well as the net biodiversity effect on functioning. 


## Files:
### AllRawData_InclBV.csv: Created file containing merged raw data including calculated cell Volume from Biovolume of species. 

no: unique ID of N x temp combination 
 
speciesID: species-specific information
 
 combination: species combinations, see MS for abbreviations
 
 temp: temperature treatment, i.e. fluctuation, increase, increase and fluctuation
